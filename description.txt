[c/ff0000:THIS MOD IS STILL A WORK-IN-PROGRESS.]
[c/ff0000:MULTIPLAYER HAS NOT BEEN TESTED.]
[c/ff0000:USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.]

This mod replaces your health with your coins.
(Any mentions of "Health" or "HP" listed below are for the coins' worth of health instead of actual HP.)

Micromanaging money just became a whole lot worse... Are you up to the challenge?

[c/bbbb00:=== CHANGES ===]
- Positive life regeneration is completely disabled.  Damage-Over-Time effects, such as "On Fire!" can still drain your health though.

- Healing via the Nurse has been replaced with a trade of [i:73][i/s50:72] for an Extra Life.
  - Once the trade has been done, you'll have to wait a few days before you can get another Extra Life.
  - Dying while having Extra Lives will instead give the player 50HP and brief invincibility.

- New and respawning players start with 50 HP
  - This amount can be increased by consuming Life Crystals [i:29] and Life Fruit [i:1291]
  - Players that were created before using this mod and have no coins are considered "new" players
  - Health modifications from sources such as the Lifeforce Potion [i:2345] are only 20% effective

- Running out of coins in your Inventory, Piggy Bank [i:87], Safe [i:346] and Defender's Forge [i:3813] will start a short countdown.  Once this countdown ends, the player will die.
  - The countdown lasts for 2 seconds in Softcore, 5 seconds in Mediumcore and for 10 seconds in Hardcore

- Picking up Hearts [i:58], Candy Apples [i:1734] and Candy Canes [i:1867] will give +3 HP

- Items that heal the player, such as the Healing Potion [i:188], will give 1/10th the normal amount of health.
  - For example, consuming a Healing Potion [i:188], which normally gives +100 HP, would give +10 HP instead.

- All monsters drop more money (except for bosses).

- All shop items that don't use custom currency, such as the Defender's Medal [i:3817], have increased prices.

- Invincibility after being hit is doubled in duration

- Pickup range for coins has been slightly increased

- The Coin Gun [i:905] has a chance to not consume ammo based on what coin type was used for ammo

[c/bbbb00:=== BUGS ===]
- Other mods trying to do things to the UI layers might cause problems
